# 🎉 Scratch and Win Game  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Scratch and Win** game is an interactive web-based application where users reveal hidden images by scratching off a black cover. The effect mimics real-life scratching, creating a smooth and realistic experience. Each time the page is refreshed, the images are **randomly rearranged**, providing a fresh challenge every time.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Realistic Scratch Effect** - Gradually erase the black cover to reveal the image below.  
✅ **Randomized Images** - The images are shuffled each time the page is refreshed.  
✅ **Canvas-Based Performance** - Uses the `canvas` element for smooth and efficient erasing.  
✅ **User-Friendly Interaction** - Click and drag to scratch, and stop when the mouse is released.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **HTML5** - Structuring the game elements.  
- **CSS3** - Styling the layout, grid, and effects.  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** - Implementing the scratch effect and randomizing images.  

## 📜 How It Works  
1️⃣ The game loads a set of images and **shuffles** them randomly.  
2️⃣ A **black canvas** is placed over each image.  
3️⃣ The user clicks and drags to **erase parts of the canvas**, revealing the image underneath.  
4️⃣ The **scratching effect** is smooth and realistic, resembling an actual eraser.  
5️⃣ The process repeats every time the page is **refreshed** with a new image arrangement.  

## 🎮 How to Play  
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.  
2. Click and drag over the black-covered areas to reveal images.  
3. Refresh the page to see a **new shuffled layout**.  

## 🎯 Future Enhancements  
🔹 Add a **winning condition** (e.g., if a specific image is revealed).  
🔹 Implement a **touch-friendly** version for mobile users.  
🔹 Add **animations and sound effects** for better engagement.
